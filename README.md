### Â¿Problem?
If you are running your Go program with sudo, it is possible that the environment variables are not loading correctly due to sudo's security settings.

One solution is to add the environment variables you need to the sudo configuration. To do this, you must edit the /etc/sudoers file using the sudo visudo command. Add the following line to the end of the file:

Defaults env_keep += "VARIABLE_NAME1 VARIABLE_NAME2 ..."
Replace "VARIABLE_NAME1 VARIABLE_NAME2 ..." with the names of the environment variables you need to access from your Go program. 

export TOKEN_GITHUB=xxx Your access token xxx.

export USER_EMAIL= xxx user email server xxx

export USER_PASS= XXX pass email server xxx
